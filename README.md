# PacMan
Using Deep Convolutional Q-Learning to train a model for PacMan


[Trained PacMan agent](https://github.com/ruchakhopkar/PacMan/assets/70127769/0f94b886-c179-4177-9d2b-697e145c5858)

We do see that the agent converges at a local minima.
However, with more compute and time, we can train the agent to reach the global minima.

EDIT: Increased the LR to achieve a better convergence.
